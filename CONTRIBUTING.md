### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Providing Translations

When providing translations...

* visit our project on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/native-lazyload) and sign in with your wordpress.org account (create one if you haven't yet)
* select the language you would like to contribute to
* provide the missing translations
    * make sure you follow the guidelines outlined in the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/)
    * stick to the translation conventions for your locale (if there are any) - you can find these [here](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/)

After having provided translations, a translation editor will review your submissions soon and approve them as appropriate.
